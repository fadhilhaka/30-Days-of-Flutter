# Introduction to Cross-Platform Development with Flutter and Dart

## What is Flutter?

[Flutter](https://flutter.dev) is Google’s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for [mobile](https://flutter.dev/docs), [web](https://flutter.dev/web), and [desktop](https://flutter.dev/desktop) from a single codebase.

**Fast Development**

Paint your app to life in milliseconds with Stateful Hot Reload. Use a rich set of fully-customizable widgets to build native interfaces in minutes.

**Expressive and Flexible UI**

Quickly ship features with a focus on native end-user experiences. Layered architecture allows for full customization, which results in incredibly fast rendering and expressive and flexible designs.

**Native Performance**

Flutter’s widgets incorporate all critical platform differences such as scrolling, navigation, icons and fonts, and your Flutter code is compiled to native ARM machine code using [Dart's native compilers](https://dart.dev/platforms).

All it's asking for is just a simple blank window. 
And what Flutter will do is, it will draw onto that blank window whatever it is that needs to be rendered and whatever animations, or interactions, or changes.
It's all painted on by Flutter.
So this means that instead of having to make iOS apps the Apple way and make Android apps the Android way, you can simply use a whole bunch of pre-built widgets from Flutter.

## Why Flutter?

Well, one of the reasons is that you'll end up with one code base to maintain, one place to debug, and one place to update.

And this is a huge advantage compared to creating your apps natively, say, creating your iOS apps in Swift and making your Android apps in Java and your web apps in JavaScript and having all of these different
places that you need to update and maintain. 

Whereas here you only need to know one language - that's [Dart](https://dart.dev/platforms).
